This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with an asynchronous operation inside. If the asynchronous operation (like a fetch request) isn't handled properly, it might cause unexpected behavior or crashes.  For example, if the component unmounts before the promise resolves, you get an error.  Another problem is that the asynchronous operations might not update the component's state properly leading to stale closures.
