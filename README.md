This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native when using the `useEffect` hook with asynchronous operations.  The `useEffectBug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `useEffectSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from improper handling of asynchronous operations within `useEffect`, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.  The solution showcases best practices for managing asynchronous operations to prevent these issues.
